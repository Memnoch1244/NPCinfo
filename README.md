Description
=====
Tired of looking every time you want to see what NPCs are in the room?

This Aardwolf MUSHClient plugin provides a miniwindow that shows NPCs currently in the same room as the player.  It will update upon killing an NPC, when an NPC enters/leaves the room, and as the player moves about in the world.  Please message me if you notice an NPC moving and the list does not update.
Note:  You must be able to see the NPC moving for the listen to update.  It will not detect sneaking or NPCs you cannot see.  If you have stacked commands, it won't update until those commands complete.

Use "npcshow" or "npchide" to toggle the miniwindow.

Note: Potentially incompatible with Aardwolf Consider Miniwin from Athlau.

Installation
=====
Install by downloading the zip file and unzipping the contents to your world/plugins folder in your MUSHclient directory.
